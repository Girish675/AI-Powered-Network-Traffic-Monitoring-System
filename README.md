# AI-Powered-Network-Traffic-Monitoring-System
A web-based dashboard that monitors network traffic and application health using AI for anomaly detection. The system will be deployed on Kubernetes for scalability and high availability.
## Tech Stack
- Kubernetes – Deploy and manage services
- Web Development – React (Frontend), FastAPI/Flask (Backend)
- AI/ML – TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn for anomaly detection
- Networking – Collect network metrics using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or custom packet analysis
## Features
- Real-time visualization of network traffic and application metrics
- AI-driven anomaly detection for unusual traffic patterns
- Automated alerts for potential security threats
- Scalable microservices deployed using Kubernetes
- APIs for external integrations
